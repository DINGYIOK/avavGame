# avavGame
A lottery game based on Avav on the Avalanche chain. The funny thing is that I used RemixIDE to write it and don’t know how to open source it on Avalanche.


随机的参与人数
随机的中奖数字

参与场次将会收取10%手续费的Avav
因为：
有一级邀请，上级可以获取下级每次参与的5%的Avav奖励
本场次内最后一个参与的用户将自动获取整个奖池4%的Avav奖励
  因为最后一个用户需要支付比较高的gas费，最后一次参与的同时也会根据随机数进行开奖
  选择数字的和开奖的数字相匹配的所有用户将平分奖池90%的Avav
剩下1%留给我自己


random number of participants
random winning numbers

Participating sessions will be charged a 10% handling fee Avav
because:
With a first-level invitation, the superior can obtain 5% of the Avav reward for each participation of the subordinate.
The last user to participate in this session will automatically receive 4% of the entire prize pool Avav reward
  Because the last user needs to pay a relatively high gas fee, the last time he participates, the lottery will also be drawn based on random numbers.
  All users who select numbers that match the drawn numbers will share 90% of the Avav prize pool equally
The remaining 1% is left to myself
